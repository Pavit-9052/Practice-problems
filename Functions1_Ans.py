'''No need to write actual code. Only pseudo code is enough
For eg 
#adds two numbers
def addnumber(num1, num2) #takes two numbers 
    #add the numbers and return the result
    return result 

#main code
#get input from users
result = addnumber(num1, num2)
print the result

Before writing code, make sure to read https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp
