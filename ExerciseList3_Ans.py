'''1. Write a function to calculate compund interest. Help the user save money by displaying the interest they 
can earn by saving certain % of thier salary, for 3 different interest rates and for 3 different % of salary
eg
  Input Rs50000
  Output - If you save 10% of your salary, with 5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)
           If you save 10% of your salary, with 6.5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)

           If you save 15% of your salary, with 5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)
           If you save 15% of your salary, with 6.5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)

           If you save 15% of your salary, with 5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)
           If you save 15% of your salary, with 6.5% interest rate, you will get (display the amount)'''

OUTPUT:-
Enter the total number of times to find compund interest:3
Enter the principal amount 1: 50000
Enter the rate of interest 1:5.6
Enter the time (in terms of years) 1:1
If your principal amount is 50000.0 with interest rate 5.6, then you will get 2800.00 in time of 1 year.
Enter the principal amount 2: 50000
Enter the rate of interest 2:6
Enter the time (in terms of years) 2:1
If your principal amount is 50000.0 with interest rate 6.0, then you will get 3000.00 in time of 1 year.
Enter the principal amount 3: 60000
Enter the rate of interest 3:6
Enter the time (in terms of years) 3:1
If your principal amount is 60000.0 with interest rate 6.0, then you will get 3600.00 in time of 1 year.

'''2. You have a message that you want to send to your friend. You don't want others to see the message. You code the message and send it.
The alg to code is - split each word in half and reverse it (eg cricket becomes ketccri), if the word ends with a vowel, split at the 
last letter and reverse (eg cinema becomes acinem), if the word has numbers, spell the number but add A as first and last letters
 (8 pm becomes AeightA pm ).
